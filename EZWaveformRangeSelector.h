//  EZWaveformRangeSelector.h
//  EZTTSLibrary
//
//  A draggable start/end range selector overlaid on top of a WaveformView. Built as a
//  UIControl subclass (beginTracking/continueTracking/endTracking), the same official
//  mechanism UISlider itself uses — NOT UIGestureRecognizer-based, because a gesture
//  recognizer on a small subview inside this screen's UIScrollView previously lost the
//  fight against the scroll view's own pan gesture. UIControl tracking doesn't have
//  that problem.
